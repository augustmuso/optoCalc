# Optometry Formulas

This project contains a collection of optometry formulas implemented in Python.

## Overview

The `core` folder contains the main module `optometry_formulas.py` which defines a class `OptometryFormulas`. This class provides various methods for performing calculations related to optometry, including prentice rule, vertex distance compensation, equivalent power, and more.

The first class of refraction prescription is represented in the `RefractionPrescription` class, which can be found in `optometry_formulas.py`.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/augustmuso/optometry-formulas.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd optometry-formulas
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

You can use the provided `main.py` script to interact with the `OptometryFormulas` class and perform calculations. Simply run the `main.py` script:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will execute example usage of the optometry formulas and print the results.
